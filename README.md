My Spanish App

I created this project to help me learn Spanish after i moved to spain. 
The program will prompt the user with a common verb and a tense, the user then inputs their answer into the window and the program will respond to the user whther the submitted answer was correct or incorrect.

The code is 100% C++ code and uses the cmake build system.
